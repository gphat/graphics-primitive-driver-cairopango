=head1 NAME

Document::Writer::TextLayout - Text layout engine

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Document::Writer;

    my $doc = Document::Writer->new(default_color => ...);
    my $p = $doc->next_page($width, $height);
    $p->add_text_to_page($driver, $font, $text);
    ...

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item I<font>

Set/Get this text layout's font.

=item I<height>

Get the height of this text layout.  Only useful after C<layout> has been
called.

=item I<layout>

Lay out the text based on the provided attributes.

=item I<lines>

Set/Get this text layout's 'lines'.  This is an arrayref of hashrefs, where
each hashref has the following members:

=over 4

=item B<box>

The bounding box for the text in this line.  This bounding box does not
take rotations into consideration.

=item B<cb>

The bounding box of required for a container that intends to contain the text
in this line.  

=item B<text>

The text in this line.

=back

This data structure is the meat of a TextLayout.  The multi-line, unwrapped
text is broken down into this datastructure based on the C<width> attribute.

=item I<slice ($offset, [$size])>

Given an offset and an optional size, returns C<n> lines from this layout
that come as close to C<$size> without exceeding it.  This method is provided
to allow incremental rendering of text.  For example, if you have a series
of containers 80 units high, you might write code like this:

  for(my $i = 0; $i < 3; $i++) {
      $lines = $layout->slice($i * 80, 80);
      # render the text
  }

=item I<text>

Set/Get the text to be laid out.

=item I<width>

Get/Set the width at which the text in this TextLayout should be wrapped.
